# Welcome to my Symfony 4.2 project

In this simple Symfony project, i build API website. 

This work is done as part of my PHP web developer training with Openclassroom - project 6.

**Attention, this blog is my reflection: I used the knowledge of different courses that I learned and put them 
into practice. In no way the errors that could be found are the fact of the people cited.**

## Installation

1. First, download the framework, either directly or by cloning the repo.
1. Run **composer install** to install the project dependencies.
1. Configure your web server to have the **public** folder as the web root.
1. Open [env.dist](/env.dist) and enter your database configuration data.
